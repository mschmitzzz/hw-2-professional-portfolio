# Week 8 Homework: Professional Portfolio (updated)

## Description

I have created a professional portfolio to showcase my web development work. It has been updated since the week 2 homework assignment to show my current understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have added my LinkedIn profile and a downloadable resume to the nav bar, updated my project portfolio and contact form, and have improved the responsive design with media queries and flexbox. This is a work in progress that will be developed more in depth as I progress through the bootcamp.
